# Pokedex
An API integrating project in vanila Js using pokeapi.co 's API made for MLH Day 1 Challenge.
This is an interphase app that allows you to view a list of pokemons and even filter them based on their type.

## Note: 
The deployed version takes some time to load. Please wait for all 150 cards to be loaded before using the filters else all the unloaded cards will be added at the end of filtered result irrespective of their type. The delay is due to constant fetching from the pokeapi.co server. Once all the 150 cards are loaded it should work perfectly.
